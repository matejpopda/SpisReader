Use the SPIS generated trajectories to verify that our trajectories are correct (approximate speed (energy) with the first two positions)

Use a spis setting to set the temperature of electrons



Simulate empty box

Generate multiple energies in one direction

Energie castice VS energie castice na konci

# Work over holidays

2d trajectories - 
plot error of each method for different dts. 

Calculate electric field from potential. # dont forget its flipped

Interpolate the electric field.

Figure out why there is an error in the last image. 



Figure out how to use jython to build spis projects 
There is a folder in the spis installation directory /resources/scripts


FIX READER - when a file is missing it should not crash, just set it to none
Numerical results does it.
