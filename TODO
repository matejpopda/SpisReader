Use the SPIS generated trajectories to verify that our trajectories are correct (approximate speed (energy) with the first two positions)

Use a spis setting to set the temperature of electrons

(Same for photoelectrons + check if sun exposed)

Rotate the output for electron detector plotter

Plot different populations differently


Simulate empty box

Generate multiple energies in one direction

Compare different integration schemes (Also find a method that interpolates electric field)

Electron detector should draw the results without spaces, filled squares
